    <p>  My Father was born on September 21st 1976. He grew up in Long Island, In the same town where I would eventuely grow up in. He would go to college at Villanova, a school in Philadelphia, and he would go to law school at Hofstra, a school in Long Island. </p>
<p> After college he would get a job working in the District Attorney office in Manhattan. This was at a time when that postion was increbily busy. After serval years working in that postion he would move to martime law firm . Martime law is the law which deals with boats. He would be increbily succseful at this firm, and made a lot of money, but he did not like working there as the hours were very long, and he had to be away from home a lot. So he would find employment at a differnt firm. He still works at that firm. He works in Estate Law, which is law that deals with what happens to peoples stuff after there death, if the Will is not clear </p>
<p> Me and my dad are very close. The picture above is a picture of me and him at the Ryder Cup, which is one of the biggest golf tourments in the world. It was a very nice time. We both are very intrested in history, so a lot of are conversations are on that topic. </p>
