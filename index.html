      <h1 class="title">This is the webistie of Thomas John McCarthy  </h1>
      <p> I was born in Long Island New York, on 07/12/2007. I was a very big baby, so big that I had to be born via a Caesarean section. Throughout my schooling, especially elementary and middle school I was a rather troublesome child. I was also pretty smart, but did not apply myself in school. This led to me being in the middle of the pack in school. However in my later years of high school I began to apply myself more in schooling. This led to me being near the top of the class in humanities. I choose to apply to Fordham on a wim, but upon visting the school I realised I wanted to go year. I found the campuses architecture to be gorgeous, and I am a firm beliver that Aesthetics is one of the most important things in order to have a happy life. I also liked how it was a Jesuit School. I also liked how it was in New York City, which I belive to be the greatest city in the world. NYC has so many thing to do. So for those reasons I choose to go to Fordham. So far I belive that. I have made the correct descion. I am having a amazing time a Fordham
