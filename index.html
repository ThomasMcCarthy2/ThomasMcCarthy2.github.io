      <h1 class="title">This is the webistie of Thomas John McCarthy  </h1>
      <p> I was born in Long Island New York, on 07/12/2007. I was a very big baby. Throughout my schooling, especially elementary and middle school I was a rather troublesome child. I was also pretty smart, but did not apply myself in school. This led to me being in the middle of the pack in school.
